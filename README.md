# nt-comp-challenge-3 - [my name is skrillex...](https://nicktu12.github.io/nt-comp-challenge-3/)

### Project

The goal of this assignment was to exemplify mastery over CSS and HTML styling by creating a page with lots of unique buttons and elements, and to make this page responsive on small screens. While the layout is true to the original comp, I took liberties with the content and slight layout changes to make room for a hero image. 

In order to maintain order on my page, I spent a considerable amount of time planning my HTML hierarchy. Additionally, heavy usage of absolute positioning is in place after the first media query, along with hiding images using the visibility CSS property.
